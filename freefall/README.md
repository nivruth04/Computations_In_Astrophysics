# Free Fall Under Gravity 

# Problem Statement:

A test object is at rest at a distance of $r_0$ = 1 AU ( ~ $1.5 \times 10^{11}$  metres) from the centre of a star of mass M = $1.9891 \times 10^{30}$ kilograms and radius R = $6.957 \times 10^{8}$ metres. This object is set to fall freely from this distance towards the star under the effect of the star's gravitational force. The variation of the distance and the free-fall velocity over time is to be determined until the object hits the stellar surface. 

# Methodology:

The underlying physical equation is expressed as a second-order ODE, and this is further split into a system of two first-order ODEs. These two first-order ODEs are then solved numerically using the following numerical methods:

1. Fourth Order Runge-Kutta Method (RK4)

2. Euler's Method
    
The accuracy of the latter is compared with that of the former at various time steps.

# Results and Observations:

1. For an initial step value in time of dt = 1000s, the RK4 and Euler's method provided similar results with slight variations in the behaviour of free-fall velocity.

2. The time of free fall was found to be approximately $5.562\times 10^{6}$ s, which is roughly 64.4 days until the object reaches the stellar surface.	

3. The accuracy of the Euler's method relative to the RK4 method was tested with dt = 100s, 1000s, 10000s, and 100000s in the Euler's Method. Significant divergence was observed in Euler's method with higher dt values, indicating that this method underestimates gravitational acceleration near impact, resulting in delayed free-fall impact.
